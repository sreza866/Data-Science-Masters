    "A thread is an entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution. Also, it is the smallest unit of processing that can be performed in an OS (Operating System). In simple words, a thread is a sequence of such instructions within a program that can be executed independently of other code. For simplicity, you can assume that a thread is simply a subset of a process! A thread contains all this information in a Thread Control Block (TCB):<br>\n",

    "Multithreading is defined as the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently. In a simple, single-core CPU, it is achieved using frequent switching between threads. This is termed context switching. In context switching, the state of a thread is saved and the state of another thread is loaded whenever any interrupt (due to I/O or manually set) takes place. Context switching takes place so frequently that all the threads appear to be running parallelly (this is termed multitasking).<br>\n",

A thread is a lightweight subprocess, and multithreading allows a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, making efficient use of available resources like CPU cores. Python's <code>threading</code> module provides a way to work with threads.\n",

    "    - We create multiple threads, each associated with the `test3` function. \n",
    "    - Each thread is passed a different value of `x`, indicating its identity.\n",
    "    - We start all the threads, allowing them to run concurrently.\n",

    "4. **Output**:\n",
    "    - As the threads execute, they print messages showing the value of `x` they received and the current value of `shared_var`.\n",
